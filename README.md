# MetabolicModelValidation
The following scripts was used for a trend validation study between indirect calorimetry and metabolic models for muscuskeletal modeling.

## Abstract
The purpose of this study was to trend validate the metabolic models: Margaria
(1968), Bhargava et al. (2004) and Umberger (2010) implemented in the Anybody
Modeling System, performing a concentric knee extension and eccentric knee flexion at different mechanical loads in a dynamometer. Each load consisted of 150
repetitions and pulmonary gas exchange was measured during each load. All three models underestimated the metabolic power compared to indirect calorimetry for
both contraction types. Where the error for all metabolic models increased with the load.
